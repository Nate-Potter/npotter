        This week I finally started my first course on Udemy. It is Jose Portilla's "The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero." <br>
        In this course Jose teaches PostgreSQL using PgAdmin as the development platform. I do not have any previous experience with SQL, but <br>
        I am very excited to dive into this course. The course consists of 12 sections and has about 9 hours of content. So far I have just <br>
        completed the first section, which involves an introduction, course overview, and the installation of PostgreSQL and PgAdmin. Stay <br>
        tuned for updates of my progress!<br><br>
